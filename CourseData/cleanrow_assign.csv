<div>For the OULAD dataset, prepare the following:
</div><div><br></div><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">a) Review the data and propose “metrics” that could assess learning or aspects of it. To do so, consider formulating a research hypothesis that would help you to investigate your assumption. Provide the reasoning for supporting the research hypothesis. <strong>For example:&nbsp;</strong></span></p><div class=""editor-indent"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;""><em>""Students who visit course materials frequently will perform better than students who do not visit course materials.</em></span></p></div><div class=""editor-indent"" style=""margin-left: 30px;""><div style=""font-size: 0.9375rem; display: inline !important;""><em>Reasoning: My assumption is based on the rationale that students who visit course materials frequently, engage more with these materials and therefore are able to accumulate and acquire knowledge more effectively than students who don’t engage with student materials.</em></div></div><div style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;""><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;""><br></span></div><div style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;""><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;""><strong>Formulate AT LEAST three research hypotheses.</strong></span><br></div><div style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;""><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;""><strong><br></strong></span></div><span style=""font-size: 0.9375rem;"">b) For the research hypotheses you formulated in (a) provide the connection to the actual data - or else, what data you would use to investigate your assumption.

one of the research hypotheses you formulated in
Assignment 1.
For this hypothesis:</p>

<p></p>

<p>a)
Provide the descriptives
for your data;</p>

<p>b)
Examine whether there are missing values. Explain how a missing value could
occur in the data, what policy would you choose to deal with it, and why. </p>

<p>c)
Examine whether there are outliers. Explain what do the outliers signify in
your case, what policy would you choose to deal with them, and why.</p>

<p>d) <strong>Bonus
[+1]-</strong>&gt; carry out the analysis (no restriction on software or method, You can use anything you like as long as you make sure I can reproduce it on my side. For example, you can use: jupyter notebook (python or R), matlab, excel, pen and paper.</p>

You will use this data to carry out the third assignment of the course. In particular, you are asked to carry out a full analysis of your data (clean, analyze, report) using what we learned during the previous weeks in order to answer the following questions:</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: left;"">1. Provide a summary of the data using descriptive statistics.&nbsp;<br>2. Choose an analytical method in order to identify ""critical"" events or instances indicated by the data. Define what ""critical"" means in this context.<br>3. Contextualize the critical event identified in the previous point (2). Knowing the circumstances (it is YOUR data) how accurately have data captured the reality? What are potential misinterpretations a researcher might have had, had they been unaware of context?<br>4. Based on the data analysis and your knowledge of context, present one automatic intervention (for example, message, notification for the student or the teacher etc.) you would find useful to receive from the system. For this intervention, propose a way of implementation on the design level (in other words, describe how the system would design and deliver the intervention in an efficient and effective way).</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: left;"">The deliverable for this assignment should be a REPORT. Additional materials (e.g. drawings, jupyter notebooks, scripts etc) are welcome!</p><p dir=""ltr"" style=""text-align: left;""><br><strong>Deadline: December 9.</strong></p>",1,1,0,1,0,0,1607551140,1606255200,10,1607787131,0,1607551200,1
